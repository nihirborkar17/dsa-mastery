# 🚀 DSA Mastery in Java – by Nihir Borkar

Welcome to my **DSA Mastery Journey**, where I'm learning and solving Data Structures and Algorithms in Java — one problem at a time.

This repository contains clean, well-commented, and thoughtfully documented code for a wide range of DSA problems. It's not just about solving problems — it's about **understanding them deeply** and helping others do the same.
